## 💻 Tech Stack

- Typescript
- Vite
- React ([w/ Valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/))
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## 🧠 Some things I've learned

- How to use React.
- Differences between Flux, Proxy, and Atomic state management.
- Animations with Framer Motion.
- Radix UI Library + the benefits of using unstyled component libraries.

## 🤔 Some future considerations

- Dark Theme (Radix UI's dark theme does not work with Vite atm)
